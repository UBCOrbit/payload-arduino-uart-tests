I managed to send data from the VM to the arduino to the Inforce, but not in a way where it gets interpreted on the other end correctly
I have no idea why this is the case, and I am tired"

I think that our problem has something to do with the stty setting of /dev/ttyHSL0

Another note, the data that is recieved is much less than what is sent, which makes me think that
this is a case of the baud rate on the Inforce not actually changing, but I should ask someone who knows something about this.
